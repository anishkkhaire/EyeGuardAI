    <h2>The Human Eye</h2>
    <p>The human eye is an incredible organ. It is the only part of the body where one can observe microvasculature (small blood vessels) and the optic nerve, a part of the central nervous system, in a completely non-invasive manner.</p>

    <h2>Retinal Photographs</h2>
    <p>Photographs of the retina, the vision-sensitive region at the back of the eye, help doctors see microvasculature and the optic nerve head in detail. These images enable the diagnosis of vision-threatening eye disorders such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Additionally, they provide insights into life-threatening conditions like hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's.</p>

    <h2>Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
    <p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) affects one in three people living with diabetes and is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. It is one of the most prevalent eye diseases, with 12,000 to 24,000 new cases reported yearly in the United States alone. Fortunately, DR is detectable and highly treatable, especially in its early stages.</p>

    <h2>Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
    <p>Diabetic Retinopathy is a progressive disease with four stages:</p>

    <h3>Mild Non-Proliferative DR (NPDR)</h3>
    <p>The first stage is marked by small swelling in retinal blood vessels called microaneurysms, which may leak fluid into the retina. Detecting and treating DR at this stage prevents future complications.</p>

    <h3>Moderate Non-Proliferative DR (NPDR)</h3>
    <p>At this stage, blood vessels swell and distort, reducing their ability to transport blood. This may contribute to the development of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), a buildup of fluid in the macular area.</p>

    <h3>Severe Non-Proliferative DR (NPDR)</h3>
    <p>Large blockages develop, cutting off vital blood flow. The retina releases growth factors to compensate, signaling the growth of new blood vessels.</p>

    <h3>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)</h3>
    <p>The most severe stage, PDR, is characterized by fragile new blood vessels growing along the retina. These can leak, bleed, and lead to scar tissue formation, which may cause retinal detachment and vision loss.</p>
